I strive to attain truth, make the world a better place, and create meaningful experiences with people. My plan of attack is balanced between qualitative and quantitative thinking, which has brought me to the field of data science.  

I’m working to perfect my mastery of the entire data science workstream and all the products along the analytics maturity curve. Additionally, I find it equally important to know how a data science team is best managed and optimally positioned within a successful organization.  

When I’m not being a numbers nerd, I enjoy listening to and playing music, reading literature, and running.
