My experience has given me an excellent grasp on the entire analytics work stream, encompassing data collection, ETL processing, data integration and manipulation, descriptive/prescriptive/predictive analytics, data visualization, and communication with internal/external customers to understand, articulate, and solve the problem at hand.  

I have the technical and qualitative skills to perform any of the above independently and proficiently, but I have also managed a team of analysts responsible delivering an entire portfolio of analytics products. I am constantly learning, and I enjoy the challenge of chasing the frontier of data science.  

If you would like to connect for any reason, please feel free to reach out to me. I always enjoy the opportunity to meet someone new.
