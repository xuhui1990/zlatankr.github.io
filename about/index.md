My goals in life are constant learning, making the world a better place, and creating meaningful experiences with people. I believe that street smarts are just as important as book smarts, and that one needs both a quantitative and a literary mind in order to truly understand reality.

I’m working to perfect my mastery of the entire data science workstream and all the products along the analytics maturity curve. Additionally, I find it equally important to know how a data science team is best managed and optimally positioned within a successful organization.  

When I’m not being a numbers nerd, I enjoy listening to and playing music, reading literature, and running.
